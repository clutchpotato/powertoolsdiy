  ## **Buying guide** 


  But before choosing the best nail gun for your project, you must know the detailed information about the nail guns. You must consider the following things before buying any nail gun. 


  ### **Nail length**


  It is an essential factor to consider for a nail gun. For thick surfaces, you should go for long nails, and thin covers prefer short nails. But usually, you must choose between 1 inch to 2-inch nail length.


  ### **Power type.**


  The power type varies for every nail gun. Some nail guns use the battery as a power source, while some nail guns use a pneumatic compressor as a power source. Pneumatic powered nailers are preferred over battery-operated nailers because they are lightweight and can run for a long time.


  ### **Nail gauge**


  It is also an essential factor to consider while buying a nail gun. Nail gauge varies for every nail gun. Usually, nail guns deliver from 11 gauge to 18 gauge nail guns.
