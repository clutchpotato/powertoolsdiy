    link: https://amzn.to/3tHDnCR
    body: >-
      The performance and specifications of the Ryobi were almost similar to
      those of Bosch. 


      The P215K drill/driver from Ryobi has a better feel and quality than the price tag would say. And it has a finer charm than a shell. To sweeten the deal, it comes with a battery and two batteries. The batteries used are typically the 18V ONE+ bags, which are the smallest. However, while charging the other, you’ll enjoy seeing the second one.


      #### Drill Ryobi (P215K1) kit includes:


      \* 2-speed reversible drill/driver Ryobi P215 18V ONE+ with variable speed release.


      \* 1/2″ hex keyless chuck


      \* 24 clutch settings


      \* 2 range speeds: 0-450 RPM; 0-1,750 RPM;

      \* Zippered pack for holding


      \* Slotted/piece of Phillips


      At the moment, major ventures are going on, but there’s still a list of small items to look for. Begin by putting the Ryobi P215 drill/driver on a squeaky, butt-numbing desk chair that needs to be discarded. But not until plundering the last dignified bastion. Some of the system screws were too tight for a manual screwdriver, but the Ryobi didn’t bat an eye.
    pros:
      - "The best size and weight ratio we’ve seen in a lightweight drill. The
        very first thing you will find when you pick up the Ryobi 18V One+ HP
        drill, if you have used other Ryobi drills, s that it is very light and
        lightweight relative to previous versions. "
      - Ryobi still gets relevant production out of this model, even with such a
        small scale.
      - Excellent value for a pack of two 1.5Ah batteries that are present in it.
    cons:
      - "No included belt hooks.  "
      - Why did Ryobi decide to develop this new battery configuration, and it
        is not an HP battery?
      - These modern lightweight tool lines do not have the external connections
        to gain from HP batteries, but they are called HP equipment.
