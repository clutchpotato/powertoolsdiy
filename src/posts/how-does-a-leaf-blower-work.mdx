  A ***[leaf blower](https://powertoolsdiy.com/category/leaf-blowers/)*** is
  used for gardening, which pushes air out of a nozzle to move trash such as
  leaves and grasses. Leaf blower made of electric and gasoline motors generates
  a current of air that used to collect leaves and debris from the garden or any
  public place. The power tool allows you to clean your yard. Let’s talk
  about ***How does a leaf blower work?***


  Leaf blowers working is as simple as the humble rake, but they are also more complicated. How does a leaf blower work? This question is essential if you want to buy one.


  So in this article, we are going to tell you how does a leaf blower work?. Before I start to elaborate on the leaf blower’s working principle, you have to know the basics of the leaf blower.

## **The basics of how a leaf blower works**

Let’s start with the basics of the all-leaf blower, based on the same fundamental principle. It works on the principle of centrifugal force. So the question may arise in your mind that what is centrifugal force?

Centrifugal force is an apparent force that is felt by an object moving in a curved path that acts outward from the center of rotation.

Well, let’s give an example of centrifugal force. We experience it when we round a curve path in a car or by bus. We see it when children ride on a merry-go-round.

Inside a leaf blower, there is a motor that rotates blades, also familiar as a compeller. The blower takes the outside air and spins it with a compeller. Spinning air is used to send centrifugal forces through small blower tubes. As the funnel is narrow as the air comes out from the funnel, it speeds up to 200 mph. This air is traveling at high speed through the funnel and sweeps the debris or leaves around your garden, and that is how a leaf blower works.

## **How much airspeed of a leaf blower?**

The airspeed of the leaf blower completely depends on the power output of the motor. Overall the speed is measured by two methods. One is mph which is how much air travel in the mile in one hour. Manufacturers also use meters per second that is how much air traveled in meters in one second. In general, one m/s is equal to 2.24 mph. If the speed of an air blower is 50 m/s, then its mph value is 114 mph approximately.

There is also a power measurement unit which is also important that is CFM cubic feet per minute. This is described as how much volume of air is passed through the funnel within a minute. If you are buying a leaf blower with high MPH, it should be considered to observe its CFM value. Being high MPH but low CFM blower will not be able to shift more leaves. So that’s is much important as the MPH value of the blower.

So make sure while buying a new leaf blower, as the higher CFM means a high volume of air passed through the funnel and MPH or m/s, you know that the power output will be strong enough to shift leaves.

## **Power source types of leaf blower**

As earlier said that inside a blower, there is a motor that rotates the fan. So how the motor is powered? There are two ways that the fan is powered. One is electricity other is gas. The gas model can be divided into a four-cycle leaf blower. Simultaneously, the electric model is divided into a two-cycle leaf blower known as a battery-powered leaf blower.

Each type has different pros and cons, but the main principle is the same. The leaf blower gets power from a battery or gas, which produces airflow, which blows the leaves from the surroundings.

Cylindrical displacement ( cc) is another way to measure power for petrol leaf blowers that indicates how fast the blower is at shifting the leaves. So higher the value of cylindrical displacement higher the power of shifting the leaves.

Gas-powered models are more powerful. Generally, they are more suitable For heavy-duty jobs. However, they are usually heavier and noisier, also cause more pollutions.

On the other hand, the electric models are quite lighter and kinder to the environment. But it hasn’t more power like gas models. They are usually used for a small home to keep clean the surroundings from unwanted leaves and debris. An electric model is easy to use because it doesn’t require storing petrol or gas, required for petrol blowers.

There is a different kind of blower one is ***[`hand-operated leaf blowers`](https://powertoolsdiy.com/best-battery-operated-leaf-blowers/)*** and another is ***`backpack leaf blowers`***.

Battery-operated leaf blowers that get power from a battery called battery-operated leaf blowers. There are many advantages of the blower. They are much easier, and second is there is no cord to give power to the motor inside this.

Even [backpack leaf blowers](https://powertoolsdiy.com/best-backpack-leaf-blowers/) are also available in the market. There is no need to carry leaf blowers in hand. It becomes easy to carry leaf blowers on a backpack and operate a leaf blower by hand.

## **How can measure power and effectiveness?**

There are many methods to estimate how powerful a leaf blower is. For **a gas leaf blower**, the ***engine’s energy is estimated in ccs, representing the amount of cylinder displacement***. The more expensive the cc rating, the more powerful the engine that powers the blower.

However, when choosing a blower for your garden, consider that more precious ***ccs*** also equate to higher fuel burning, so getting one more powerful than you require will cost you higher in the long run. The potential of electric blowers is measured in watts or amps.

 However, if you think that high powerful motor will give you better performance, you are wrong. Its performance depends on the airspeed of the blower. But this is not everything; you should have to look at the air volume that an air blower can move. To watch how much air a blower can propagate, you should look at the **CFM** rating; ***CFM stands for cubic feet per minute***.

The best combination of idol blowers should have a powerful motor, a good wind speed rating, and a large CFM capability.

## **The process of vacuuming, collecting, mulching, and shredding**

Almost leaf blowers have an inbuilt vacuum setting; the vacuum is directed to the collection bag. There is an exception with a plastic strip at the bottom of the tube to direct the airflow to collect the leaves and collect them into a collection bag. Then the question arises in mind that what to do with the leaves after collecting in collecting bags?

* ![backpack leaf blowers](https://powertoolsdiy.com/wp-content/uploads/autumn-161776_1280-1024x894.png)

Several types of vacuum machines are available with Inbuilt shredding or mulching capabilities where the machine shredded the leaves after collecting them into collecting bags.

There are two methods in which leaves are stripped for mulch. The most popular way is that the fan or compeller counterparts as the chipper shredder and chops the leaves up as they move through it.

Though, this hazards the fan being destroyed if something difficult is sucked up with the leaves, and some models consolidate shredding lines alternately.

When the leaves are removed from the machine, they are received in a bag, and when taking a leaf blower, you will also require to pay obeisance to the mulching or shredding ratio. This relates to how little the leaves are shredded, so for example, if ten bags of unshredded leaves can be decreased to the size of one bag of mulch, the ratio will be 10:1.

According to your specifications, leaves shredded and received in a bag can then be added to your fertilizer heap or separate directly over your garden as mulch.

## **Types of vacuum fan**

There are mainly two types of vacuum fans available in the market today. There are a clean fan and a dirty fan. Both have their pros and cons in the field as required for blowers in various gardening types.

The dirty fan is unusual because it is the fan or the impeller that destroys the leaves before passing them into the collection bag. This means there are fewer components, but and there is a greater risk of breaking the fan.

This is particularly true if the leaves are collected in areas with hard things like rocks. What you do agree with the dirty fan, however, is a much more powerful mulching ratio. The leaves are stripped into much smaller pieces than a clean fan way would be ready to deliver.

These vacuum types are very powerful because they are cleaned daily to ensure they stay in working positions for longer. The trash from the fans, collection areas, and any air channels will all need to be cleaned to keep the vacuum running optimally. A total fan system on the other fan uses shredding lines to strip the leaves and gives much more strength to the fan of the machine if you carelessly absorb up complex objects.

## **Vacuum Bag Capacities**

Most blower vacuums arrive with their set bags added. Determining the type of vacuum for the garden grows very important due to the different fan types.

Regular fans that don’t shred the leaves into small pieces will require more regular emptying. Depending on how big your garden and how many leaves you will generally need to shift this may not be an issue. It depends on the area of land you want to clean.

## **An irreplaceable gardening tool**

When the leaves fall from trees, it should be clean to look garden beautiful, for this blower is an irreplaceable gardening tool. It helps you to keep the garden clean and leaf-free. As you understand how a blower works, you can choose the best for your requirements.
