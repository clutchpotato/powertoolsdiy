  Keeping your yard looking honed is an essential piece of life if you are an
  owner of one. A well maintained and beautifully kept up yard not just upgrades
  your home's look; it also increases the overall worth of your house.


  Considering this fact, it makes a lot of sense to keep your yard clean and in pristine condition. A robotic lawn mower struggles with a big lawn, so the only logical choices are either a walking mower or a riding lawnmower.


  If you have a small lawn, you should choose a walking lawn mower as they are cheaper. But if you are an owner of a big yard and are hoping to spend less time and energy mowing your lawn, then getting a riding lawn mower is the logical thing to do.


  This guide will help you track down the correct one by inspecting factors like your lawn’s size, kind of lawn and type of terrain, and its unique features of the yard have.

  ## Conclusion


  Push lawn mowers to have their own perks, like better flexibility when it comes to tighter spots or if you have too many distractions on your lawn. On the other hand, riding lawn mowers offer great comfort while mowing your lawn, and the cuts are perfect.


  If you are an owner of a small to a medium lawn or if your lawn has greater slopes, then push lawn is your choice to go. On the other hand, if you have a big lawn, then riding a lawnmower is good for you because it has a greater wheel radius, and you don't have to push it.

## Size of Your Lawn

The size of your lawn is an essential factor when you are picking a lawnmower. Assuming you have an enormous yard with a different land section, your mower will require the chops to provide the best results while saving time.

By having a single pass, meaning just cutting one segment of land, you can check the blade's width and how much it can cut in a single pass. The greater the cut width, the more grass you will be able to cut, and depending on the width, the more you can save time.

The lawnmowers with a cutting width of 30 to 42 inches work well for lawns under one acre.  Lawns at least five or more acres in size will regularly require a cutting width of at least 54 inches. If you have a mower with smaller blade width, then prepare yourself to be in the fields for the whole day. 

By knowing what you and your lawn require beforehand will help you in choosing the right lawnmower. By doing so, you will save time and energy, not to mention money, if you buy the wrong lawn mower for your lawn.

## Knowing your Terrain

Is your lawn full of obstacles, and is it challenging to navigate? If your lawn is full of obstacles, then consider a riding lawn mower with a tight turning radius. It helps when steering around tight spots and corners, which might pose a challenge.

A tighter turning radius gives smoother handling of the mower and better cuts. A mower turning radius is usually represented in inches, and the smaller the number, the smaller the turning radius.

In the meantime, if your yard contains a lot of things like flower beds or bushes, at that point, a zero-turn mower might be more helpful. With a zero-turn mower, you will utilize a couple of levers rather than a directing wheel to move.

Zero-turn mowers turn in a minimal space, with a turning radius of 0 inches. They have a high mowing speed compared to any other mower. That allows them to cut around close edges while giving perfect cuts.

## Attachments

Riding lawn mowers are versatile; not only do they cut grass efficiently they also come with many different attachments. An example of attachments is dump carts which give you the option of cleaning the debris and other materials with relative ease.

Another great attachment it comes with is snow plows and snowblower attachments. These attachments are convenient if you need to remove snow from your lawn.

## Really Comfortable

Riding lawn mowers are comfortable for one fact that you can ride the mower instead of pushing it. They offer great comfort features, especially if you are riding for more extended periods.

On the off chance that long rides are a cause of worry, search for a mower with a high back seat, lumbar help, and armrests, as they can help keep you comfortable for a more extended ride. Some riding mowers also incorporate cup holders to keep you hydrated while you are out mowing. There are additional choices for expanded extra space, elastic foot pedals, and significantly more.

## Riding Lawn Mower vs Pushing Lawn Mower

Riding and push mower are two totally different lawn mowing tools. Even if you are using a standard pushing lawnmower or a self-moving model, it will expect you to stroll behind the instrument and guide it across your lawn.

Push lawn mowers are incredible for generally level yards that are either little or average in size.

This is on the basis that the device will depend on you to drive it forward, which can be really exhausting if you have a great property to cover. On the other hand, self-propelled models require basically no muscle to progress except for expecting you to stroll behind them.

Furthermore, for a self-propelled model, you can hope to spend somewhere in the range of $500 and $800. Maintenance of these lawnmowers, as well as an operational expense, is another factor that varies between these models.
