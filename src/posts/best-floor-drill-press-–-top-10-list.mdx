      If you’re searching for a firm yet **lightweight drill press,** the WEN 4208 8 inches could be the one for you. Drilling press made of titanium. The WEN 4208 has a 13 horsepower induction motor that operates on 120 volts and 60 hertz (HP). This drill press delivers a lot of great versatility for a fraction of most similar units’ price. It will render drill bit quick change and allow you convenient access to the chuck key. This drill’s speed varies from 740 RPM to 3,140 RPM.


      The drill’s excellent worktable, measuring 61/2 by 61/2 inches, is adjustable, and the drill head is suitable for dealing with more significant pieces of wood or metal. Lock depth modification, for example, guarantees precise drill holes by minimizing rotation and allowing distance to be managed. The WEN 4208 has a 12-inch keyed chuck that helps you shift drill bits and drill to full depths. This drill press is famous because it will level to 45 degrees on the left or right, enabling you to create a right-angled hole.


      #### Specifications for the drill:


      This drill press has five speeds for drilling in a variety of materials. We still expect an excellent tempo to energize our work. The five rates are 740, 1100, 1530, 2100, and 3140 RPM.  The reliable 1/3 HP induction motor generates sufficient force and strength, which is the most noticeable feature. Aside from that, the swing is only 8 inches long. Aside from that, the engine runs on 120 volts, 60 Hz, and produces 1/3 horsepower. The worktable is 6-1/2 x 6-1/2 inches in dimension and can be changed in height.

With five preset speeds that you can choose from, the engine can reach a peak speed of 3,050 RPM and easily match the task’s rate at hand. The system leaves polished, splinter less drill holes at the peak speed setting (3,050 RPM).


      Like we said, one of the significant aspects of this drill is that it comes with a bump-off button. It is placed on the front of the system and has a safety key that prevents anyone (especially children) from turning on the device when it is not in operation. This design demonstrates that protection is taken very seriously by the maker and that special recognition is warranted.

      Chuck has a 1/2-inch key. There is a bump-off option for additional security. Repetitive drilling work surface tilts from 0 to 45 degrees left or right—2-beam X2 laser for proper hole orientation.
