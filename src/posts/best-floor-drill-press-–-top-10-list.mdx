The system leaves polished, splinter less drill holes at the peak speed setting (3,050 RPM).


      Like we said, one of the significant aspects of this drill is that it comes with a bump-off button. It is placed on the front of the system and has a safety key that prevents anyone (especially children) from turning on the device when it is not in operation. This design demonstrates that protection is taken very seriously by the maker and that special recognition is warranted.

      Chuck has a 1/2-inch key. There is a bump-off option for additional security. Repetitive drilling work surface tilts from 0 to 45 degrees left or right—2-beam X2 laser for proper hole orientation.
