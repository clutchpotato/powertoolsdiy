Oftentimes when your software gets outdated, then there occur problems like Corsair not detecting your keyboard. So, to solve it, you can try updating the software. Follow these below-given simple steps to update the software: c

If you think the issue lies with the hardware compatibility, you can do the following things:

2. Check if your device is on the list. 
3. If it is, then great, however, if it is not present in the list, this means the problem lies with the hardware. You will not be able to connect the peripheral and ICUE, no matter how hard you try. 
4. Change the hardware, and the issue will be solved. 

### 5 - Change BIOS Switch 

When you feel that the issue of no detection rises from the disturbance in the position of corsair switches, you can d the following things: 

1. Launch ICUE and navigate to the screen with an error. Make sure to connect the peripheral to the correct USB port while you perform this action. 
2. Now, carefully locate the BIOS switches just the way it is shown in the figure. Try connecting the peripheral again to check whether it detects the device or not. 
3. If it gets detected, you can change to some other BIOS mode easily and keep doing it until you’re upon the correct mode. 

If you cannot find any switches on your keyboard, you can do the following steps: 

1. Enter the BIOS mode by holding the Win key and F1 simultaneously for around 3 seconds. 
2. Hold the same button for the same amount of time, and you will exit the BIOS mode. Figure out if it works for your keyboard detection. 

### 6 - Create New CUE Profile

## Reasons Why your Keyboard is not Showing up with ICUE 

There may be many reasons which can lead to this problem, like the bad USB port, outdated drivers, ICUE not having control and others. Some of the most common reasons why the ICUE is not detecting your keyboard and not letting you have control over your keyboard functionality are as follows: 

### 1 - Outdated ICUE

This may be one of the issues when your ICUE gets outdated. The newest softwares are meant to be compatible with the newest devices. So, when your ICUE is outdated, it is not able to detect your keyboard. 

### 2 - Hardware Incompatibility 

Sometimes, the hardware doesn’t match the keyboard supported by the ICUE, and you will face the problem of having control over it through ICUE as it may not be meant to be controlled by it. 

### 3 - Problems with BIOS Switches 

Corsair keyboards come with several BIOS switches on them. When these BIOS switches on the corsair device are not in the correct position, then you will face this issue as the engine will not detect the peripheral. 

### 4 - Corrupt ICUE Profiles 

ICUE comes with several profiles that are saved in the software, which control the reaction of your devices, RGB pattern and other things. When these profiles get corrupted, you will face no detection issue with your keyboard. 

### 5 - Problems with USB ports 

This issue is seen mostly ignored among most of the users; however, it can be the reason why your keyboard is not being detected. A bad USB port just doesn’t detect the device (in this case, keyboard) that you have connected, and you will experience various issues, among which one is no detection. 

If this is becoming the reason for the problem, you can change the port and resolve the issue instantly. 

### 6 - Non-responsive Peripheral 

There is also a chance that your peripheral is not working as it is meant to be. With this thing, you can do a hard resetting of the peripheral and get it working once again. 

### 7 - ICUE Error

This issue might occur when the peripheral control systems are in an error state and are not able to detect your keyboard. You can simply restart them and get them running once again. 

### 8 - Device Issue

If you think none of the above reason matches your problem, then there are chances that there is some issue with your device. You can go to Corsair officials by opening a support ticket and see if they have a way out for you.
