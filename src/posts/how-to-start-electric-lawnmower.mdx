## Types of Electric Lawnmower

An electric grass mower is unbelievably helpful to you if you have a little to a mid-sized lawn that you need to keep clean and crisp. There are two kinds of electric lawnmower.

* Cordless battery-fuelled electric lawnmower.
* Corded electric lawnmower.

Every lawn mower has its advantages and disadvantages, and you need to figure out your needs to help you choose which electric lawn mower can best serve your requirements.

### Cordless Electric Lawnmower

A rechargeable battery fuels cordless electric lawnmowers. Depending upon the model, the battery voltage goes from 18 volts to 36 volts. The higher the voltage, the more power the lawnmower will pack.

Since cordless electric lawnmowers do not have a cord attached to them, they offer unrestricted movement and a great range compared to corded lawnmowers.

While the battery of the battery-powered lawn mower offers great movement, it can also be a disadvantage. You can utilize a cordless electric lawn mower; if the battery has power, you will need to charge it again once the battery is finished.

That means if you have a long task of mowing, you will need to recharge it a couple of times while you mow.

### Corded Electric Lawnmower

The corded lawn mowers are powered directly by a cord attached to an electric plug. Having a cable running around the lawn, you must make sure you don’t get the cable in the mowers blades and cause an accident.

Having a cord also limits the mower’s range as the cord can only extend to a limited length. It is possible to you an extension, but it will only add more cable to worry about. At this point, the only thing going for corded lawn mowers is their price.

Unlike their cousins, corded lawn mowers are a lot cheaper.

### Reasons you Should Buy an Electric Mower

It is a common belief among a lot of peoples that a petrol lawnmower is superior to an electric lawnmower. When we consider that petrol engines have two-stroke engines, they can produce power far beyond anything an electric lawn mower ever can.

Petrol lawnmowers have their perks when it comes to owners who have a lot of ground to cover or if you are working on a golf course. If you have a small to mid-range lawn, buying a petrol lawnmower is overkill; it will cost you a lot in the long run.

Here are a few reasons why you should buy an electric lawn mower if you have a small to mid-range lawn.

1. Less noise pollution.
2. Use and maintenance.
3. Fuel saver.
4. Money saver.
5. Environment friendly

### Less Noise Pollution

There are areas that an electric lawn mower cannot be defeated in. a petrol lawnmower is noisy and can only dream of being as quiet as an electric lawnmower. If you are using a petrol lawnmower, then also buy a pair of noise-canceling earphones to protect your ears.

Petrol mowers make 95-decibel sounds, and hearing loss is expected after prolonged use if you continue to hear sound above 90 decibels. On the other hand, an electric lawn mower is a lot of quitter clocking in at 75 decibels.

Another problem with petrol lawnmowers is you will constantly get noise complaints from your neighbors. On the other hand, electric lawnmowers are quiet to the point that even you can barely hear them, and your neighbors will love you for that.

### Use and Maintenance

Electrical lawn mowers are easy to use and are lighter when compared to petrol lawnmowers. This makes the maneuverability of electric lawnmowers a lot faster and easier than petrol mowers.

If you have an electrical lawn mower, then say goodbye to back pain and strained shoulders as you no longer have to push as hard. With a cordless mower, you do not need to worry about the cord; all you need to do is press the switch and start mowing.

When it comes to its maintenance, it is simple as there is no need for petrol or gas; all the mower requires is a simple wipe down after use.

### Saves Fuel

Suppose you had a petrol lawnmower at some point or have one even now, then you must be familiar with what it takes to keep it working. Have an electrical lawn mower eliminates the need for oil or petrol for the mower to function.

While it is true that even electrical lawnmowers require lubrication once in a while to function without any problems, but it is occasionally to keep the joints from drying out.

Also, the oil used is different, and it is a lot easier to use than one for petrol/gas engines.

### Money Saver

If you have a petrol lawnmower, you will need to buy petrol by the gallons for it to work. On the other hand, the electric lawn mower does not require petrol; you need to plug it in an electrical outlet.

Not only are electrical lawnmowers cheaper to power they also require less maintenance. There is no need to spend on a tune-up, oil change, fuel filters changing, and spark plugs changing as electrical lawn mowers have no need for these things.

### Environment Friendly

Knowing the current situation of the planet the pollution protection is vital and a top priority for any device. If you are an environmentally conscious person, then you need an electric lawnmower.

It requires no fossil fuel for its working, and no fuel means no smoke and no harmful stuff released into the environment. Not only that, imagine how much fuel is spilled when you are filling the tank

 of the mower.

Where do you think that petrol ends up? Yes, you guessed the atmosphere and damaged it directly.

## How To Start an Electric LawnMower

There are two types of electric lawnmowers, and each has a different method of starting up. To help you avoid any mistakes while starting the mower, we have mentioned the proper way of starting both types of mowers.

### Battery Lawnmower

The first step in starting a battery-powered or cordless law mower is inserting the key. After you have done that, all you need to do is press the button or pull back the level that most of the lawn mowers have.

If it does not start for any reason, there are a few things that you can do to fix it. First, you need to check if the battery is adequately charged. The second thing that you can do is you should check if any other batteries that you know are charged work in the mower or not to confirm it the battery at fault, not the mower. Few mowers come with different batteries, so it is really not hard to check.

Finally, you should if the connection of the battery and the motor of the mower is clean and if any dirt is on it, then try removing it. For cleaning the connection, look for a plug by the batteries; if it looks dirty, then clean it. After you have cleaned it, give the engine another start.

### Corded Electrical Mower

Corded mowers are really not different from battery-powered mowers. The only difference is that you need to plug them into an electrical outlet. After you have plugged it in the electrical source, insert the key that comes with the mower, and from there, it should be very easy to start the mower.

If you any reason the mower does not start, here are a few things you can try to make it work. Firstly, check if the connection has power for it to work; if not, plug the cord in another outlet.

Secondly, make sure that you are using the correct power cord for your device. If you are using the correct cord, then you might be compromising on the flow of current for the device to start.

Lastly, if nothing seems to work, then you might want to call the local repairman and have the mower fixed.

## Conclusion

If you are an owner of a small to mid-sized lawn, then the electric lawn mower the ideal for you. It is cost-efficient, easy to use, and, most of all, environmentally friendly.

We recommend you buy an electrical lawn mower to save your back from straining and your pockets from being emptied on fuel cost.
