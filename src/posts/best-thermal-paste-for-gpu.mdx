faq:
  - ques: "Why applying thermal pastes on GPU is necessary? "
    ans: Often time your PC gets super-hot and extremely slow as the components are
      not transferring the heat suitable across the system. Applying the best
      thermal pastes can help you eliminate the issue as they make the
      components transfer heat to the heatsink effectively.
  - ques: "What happens if you don’t apply the paste on GPU?                "
    ans: Thermal paste is necessary to help the GPU to transfer the heat most
      effectively to the heatsink. If you do not apply the thermal paste to your
      GPU system, the heat cannot be transferred, and your system will get
      extremely hot and will eventually die.
  - ques: Does replacing GPU thermal paste help?
    ans: "Replacing thermal paste on your GPU can really help in improving the
      cooling operations and helps it run at greater speed. However, to get the
      optimal results, you need to buy and apply the best thermal pastes that
      are famous for the purpose. "
