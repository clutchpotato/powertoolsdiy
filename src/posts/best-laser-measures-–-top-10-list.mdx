  ## Final Verdict 


  After reviewing every laser measurement tool I concluded that ***Tacklife HD 60 laser measuring tool*** is best among the top 10 best laser measures. As it contains multiple features at an affordable price. This laser tool is perfect for professionals, architects, and beginners. However, you can choose the best laser measurement tool according to your requirements and budget.


  ## **Things to Consider While Buying Laser Measurement Tools.**


  The choice of laser measurement tool depends upon your requirements and budget. However, before buying any measurement tool, you should consider the following things in common.


  ### **Range**


  The range shows how far a laser tool can show precise measurements. The measuring range of every tool varies. Some laser tools can measure the range up to 300 feet while some tools have a measuring capacity of fewer than 50 feet. If you are a professional user, then go for the 200-300 measurement range. And if you are a beginner or home user, then a 60-100 feet measurement range is enough for you.


  ### **Accuracy**


  While buying laser measurement tools accuracy is the most important point that needs to be considered. When you use a formal tape measure, then it does not provide accurate results. Each laser measure tool has a varying level of accuracy. However, 1/16 inch accuracy providing tools are best to consider. If you are professional and can afford expensive tools, then go for 1/32 inch accuracy providing tools.


  ### **Functions**.


  As there are different types of laser tools in the market. So, some laser measurement tools provide basic functions while some are equipped with advanced or multiple functions. Each laser measure tool should provide.


  * Area measurements

  * Volume measurements.

  * Distance measurements 


  More advanced measurement includes 


  * Pythagorean measurements.

  * Addition or subtraction measurements

  * Continuous measurement

  * Min or max measurement 


  A good laser measuring tool is easy to use, portable, lightweight, and durable must provide a clear display in dim light and contain an IP54 protection tool.
