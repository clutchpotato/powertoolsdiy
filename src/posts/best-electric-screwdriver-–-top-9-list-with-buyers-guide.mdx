  ### **Torque**


  It is the force needed to drive a screw into the wall. High torque is required if you want to work with hard surfaces. Low torque is necessary if you’re going to work with soft bodies.


  ### **Speed**


  Speed is described as rotations per minute. You should go for a screwdriver that provides high rotations per minute.
