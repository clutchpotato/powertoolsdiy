  ## How to Choose the Best Motherboard For Intel Core i7-4790k


  While buying the Motherboard for your [i7 4790k](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/80807/intel-core-i7-4790k-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz.html), you need to consider some things, including SATA ports, PCI slots, Form Factor, RAM, and Processor Socket. These things are most important in a motherboard, and if you ignore considering these, you can make a choice that you will be regretting your whole life. 


  ### SATA Ports 


  Considering the number of SATA ports is most important when you are buying a motherboard for your i7 4790k processor. The function of each SATA port is to connect the storage drives and an optical drive. These drives also include SSD and HDD. 


  So, it is important that you buy a motherboard that has all the SATA ports that you need to connect the drives that you have installed in your processor. 


  Also, it is important that you make sure the Motherboard you are buying must offer SATA 6 GBs standard-most commonly known as SATA 3.0. 


  ### PCI Slots 


  Another important thing for you to note in a motherboard is that whether the Motherboard you are buying contains the PCI slots to meet all your requirements. 


  A PCI slot is a port or a connection in a motherboard that is most popularly known as expansion slots and is used to connect the expansion cards within the Motherboard. 


  Do, these ports/slots are very important for you to consider, keeping in view the type of your PC usage; gaming, office work, etc. 


  However, if you are a gamer and are fond of playing high-profile online games, you need to have a motherboard that contains one full-speed PCI Express x16 slot. 


  ### Number Of RAM Slots


  Your Motherboard will decide for the type as well as the amount of RAM you can have in your PC, so be very mindful of this thing before buying a motherboard for you. 


  Whatever, Motherboard you may have; i7 4790k or other, it is always best to find a motherboard that comes supporting at least 16 GB or RAM. 


  This will give you a handsome choice of installing as many RAMs as possible, leading up to 16 GB in total. 


  Additionally, one other thing that you can look up to in a motherboard, and that is whether it offers four or more memory slots or not? If it has, you will get a great option to install two memory slots initially and can upgrade it further in the future when you need it. 


  ### Processor Socket 


  Lastly, another most crucial thing to look for in a motherboard is the Processor Socket. 


  There is a wide variety of sockets that different motherboards offer. But for Intel processors just like the one you have-i7 4790k, LGA sockets work best. So, if you have an i7 4790k processor with you, we suggest you have a motherboard that comes with an LGA processor socket. 


  So, these were some things that we consider are most important to consider when you are out to buy a perfectly compatible motherboard for your processor.


  ## Some Final Words 


  If you want the best Motherboard for i7 4790k, you can choose any one listed among the list. However, you can still think about specific features of your processor to select its right partner.
