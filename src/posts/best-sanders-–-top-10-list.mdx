  Who does not have wood or furniture at home or in the office? 


  This integral component of our home and workplace is always noticeable in terms of beauty, storage, and other functionality. 


  Everything has wear and tear but when it comes to wood, it can always be repaired. Mostly, the wood material of furniture gets small repairs or the shiner wears away. These can be done easily with ourselves but only if we have the right gear.


  Sanders are always needed to repair or construct wood parts. They smooth the rough surfaces by scrubbing or scratching the surface with the sandpaper attached to the sanders.


  So, it’ll be a good decision to buy a sander if you want to fix the furniture and ceiling works by yourself. In this article, we’ll list some of the best sanders available in the market so that you can compare them considering your budget and usage.


  Before counting down on your list for the top 10 sanders, let us understand some concepts beforehand.[](<>)


  ## Cordless Sanders vs Corded Sanders


  Cordless sanders are the ones that come with an electric motor powered by AC power connected to a socket by a cord while cordless power tools including cordless sanders are the battery-powered ones. These battery-powered sanders don’t mean that the battery is inbuilt rather for many of the sanders, the battery and charger have to be purchased separately.


  ## Random Orbit Sander VS Orbital Sanders


  Orbit means the movement of the sandpaper in a circle. In orbital sanders, the movement is a specified orbit, that doesn’t change. However, random orbit sanders have a mechanism in which the movement of the sanding pad is in random orbit. This removes the swirl marks that are created by the continuous movement of the sanding pad in the same direction.


  ## Orbit per minute (OPM)


  This means how many times the sanding pad orbits in a minute. Let say for example the OPM is 12000. This means the sanding pad rotates 12000 times in one minute.

    name: SKIL PWRCore 20 Brushless 20V
    body: >-
      Another ultimate power 20V Sander is the SKIL PWRCore 20 Brushless 20V
      5-Inch Random Orbital Sander. This sander comes with a 20V battery and a
      charger. It has a digital brushless motor that can deliver up-to 12000
      Orbits per minute. It is a random orbit sander that ensures the
      elimination of swirl marks while sanding.


      It has a jump power charger that charges the battery in 5 minutes that will deliver up to 30 minutes run time. It offers some unique features too. Let’s discuss some of its features:

    name: Bosch ROS20VSC Palm Sander
    body: >-
      If you are a frequent DIY user or you frequently work outdoor, this Bosch
      sander might be the perfect choice for you. Having a 2.5 Amp motor makes
      it powerful enough to serve you with whatever work you need to do. Having
      a cord length of 5.5 meters is another plus point in assisting you in
      working outdoors or even indoors where you can’t find a switch nearby. The
      motor runs at the sander at a speed of 5,500 to 12000 orbits per minute
      (OPM). This will help you sand the material with an amazing finish.
      Another thing to keep in mind is that it is a random orbit sander which
      means the orbits are not in one path. This is effective in eliminating any
      swirl marks that appear after sanding. It has a pad dampening braking
      system that also helps to remove the swirl marks.


      It comes with a vibration control system that helps in protecting muscles stress and fatigue. It also has a lock-on button that eliminates the need of pressing the button while using it.

    pros:
      - "Comfortable grip "
      - Vibration control suspension
      - "Reduced swirl marks due to pad dampening system. "
      - The paper filter and screw-off cap for small dust particles
    cons:
      - "It is not cordless "
      - A bit expensive
      - "A 5.3lb weight, heavier as compared to other tools "
