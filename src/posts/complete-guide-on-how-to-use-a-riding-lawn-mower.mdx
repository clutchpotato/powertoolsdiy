  lawnmowers which are pushed to use, this type of lawnmower has an operating
  seat that can be used to operate the mower mechanically. Due to this reason,
  this lawnmower is sometimes called a tractor.

  These mowers have large multi-blade mounted on the tractors and are designed for a large expanse of grass like a golf course or a municipal park. Although they are good on open fields, they require a lot of maneuverability for the complex Trane.
